# Loshon

### Introduction

Loshon is a block-based note-taking (inspired by notion obviously, I'm obssessed with how notion does things). It consists of NextJS for the Web frontend and API written using Golang.

_Currently, I am not sure the direction of this application so I've been doing whatever I feel like implementing_

Here's the entire tech stack:

- NextJS
- ShadCN UI
- TailwindCSS
- Golang
- GORM
- PostgreSQL
- Clerk (for authentication)
- AgoliaSearch (for advanced searching)
- Edge store (for file storage)

For deployment:

- Vercel
- Render.com

### Features

Loshon has basic features a modern note-taking application should have:

- Notes are organized in a tree-like manner which allow nested child documents
- Block editor with customizable formatting
- Archiving and Restoring notes
- Publishing notes
- Quick and robust searching using AgoliaSearch
